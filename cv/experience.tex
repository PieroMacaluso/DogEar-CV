      \begin{cvparagraph}
I spent one semester of my degree path at Eurecom, a leading research centre in France, as visiting researcher student to work on the project of my master thesis.
During this experience, I developed my knowledge about Reinforcement Learning, a cutting-edge branch of Machine Learning which grows from neurocognitive psychology and that is capable of improving at tasks with a process of trial and error. The research focused on model-free approaches. The thesis aims to implement a control system for a small toy robot where to exploit and compare the last-mentioned algorithms to learn how to drive. We focused on real-world experiences using the front camera of the robot as input, without the aid of simulators or models of the environment.
