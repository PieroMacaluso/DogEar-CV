I developed my computer science knowledge during my Bachelor and Master's degree, thanks to didactical projects and laboratories.
An essential experience in this direction was the internship with Feedback Italia where I discovered how a typical business environment works and learned how to work proficiently in a team.
The semester I spent on the thesis represents the most valuable experience for my career so far because I experienced research in an exciting and brand new field.
I find myself in a very challenging but familiar environment, filled up by brilliant PhD students, professors and fresh ideas about the latest technology in computer sciences.

  During my adolescence, I participated with commitment in the staff team of voluntary initiatives as an educator where I gained functional moderator capabilities in the management of events with large groups of people, but also how to compare ideas and to understand different points of view. Moreover, during my professional and research experiences, I acquired communication skills through continuous contact with customers and colleagues. Furthermore, I gained a lot of soft skills such as problem-solving, time management, decision making and the ability to work under pressure. Living in "Collegio Renato Einaudi" merit residence and facing didactic team projects, enabled me to develop team management, leadership, conflict resolution, adaptability skills.
