\begin{cvparagraph}
    During my free time, I like to trekking or organising trips in cities or countrysides together with my friends and colleagues. I think that sharing is one of the main principles that I managed to make mine during my university life thanks to the great opportunity that "Collegio Einaudi" merit residence has given to me. I love to meet different people to discover different points of view, new bits of knowledge and unusual experiences. I think that sharing allows people to enrich each other in every aspect of our lives, both professional and personal ones.
